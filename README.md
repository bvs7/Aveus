# This World
Almost 1,000 years ago, a calamity shook the world. The continent of Aveus fell into a period of disarray and mistrust. A five century sized void sits in the annals of history. Between years 0-500 PC (post calamitat) very little is known and similarly very little is know about the cause or outcome of this calamity. From before the year 1 AC (ante calamitat), artifacts of the Glorious Civilization, the Old Empire that stretched across the continent exist. One such evidence of that society is the Sun Road (Via Sol). A massive highway that once stretched from Eastern Sea to Western Sea. 

When in the East, the Civitates, (autonomous city-states) finally rose from the ashes of the Empire, Via Sol was overgrown, in disrepair, and nigh unusable. Travel from one Civitas to another was dangerous, as Post Calamitat wilds held new threats since the age of the Empire. Slowly civilization expanded, with the reconstruction of the Viae. 

Around 400 years later, in the Spring of 983 PC, a great region has been reclaimed. Civitates protect the farmlands near them, making the safest lands those closest to a reconstructed Via. The farther West you travel, the farther you likely are from a Via, and the less likely you are to be under the might of a Civitas.

Some prefer life away from the auspices of a Civator or of a Senate, and they often travel West until they strike a balance between Freedom and Safety. The Sun Road now stretches all the way to the Tyrra River, where sits Fort Tyrrasol.

# Races
## Humans
Most Civitates are human founded and human run. Human civilization is the most populous and usually the most accepting of other races and cultures. They depend very heavily on Viae, more so than other races. Unlike the other races, Human populations and settlements grow quickly, and this is one main reason they are so populous in the resurgence after the Calamitat.
## Dwarves
Dwarves build strongholds in the Mountains and Hills to the Northwest the East Coast. They are nominally tied together under a Dwarven King, but many clans and factions exert control over dwarven society. A large network of tunnels connects much of their civilization.
## Elves
Elves have old settlements in The forests and swamps of the South (Wood Elves), and also the coniferous forest to the North (High Elves). The elven cities on Viae benefit much from trade, but many elves dislike the commotion and destruction that comes with Via construction and travel, and prefer natural forest paths instead.
## Halflings
Some small halfling settlements exist along riverbanks, in grasslands, and other gentle land. They are typically subsistence farming communities and get along well with humans. Most Halfling settlements along Viae can no longer be called halfling settlements as the halfling population has been long outnumbered.
## Gnomes
While some guess that Gnomes once had ancestral homelands, today's gnomes have been fully adopted into human society, and are pretty evenly interspersed in human life in Civitates. Humans and gnomes usually get along quite well.
## Dragonborn
Very rarely are such beings sighted. Dragonborn are sometimes found in small clans, but more often than not are solitary.
## Orcs
Orcs are typically nomadic, and very loyal to their clans. Orcs clans make great mercenaries and are often on the front lines against the dangerous wilderness that threatens to impose itself on civilization. In Andarad there is a legend of a clan of orcs that saved the civitate and were given homes and honor for their bravery. To this day, Andarad has a sizeable Orc population. Not all Orc clans can come to such mutually beneficial arrangements, and many have spent time looting farms and villages for subsistence.
## Goblinoids
Goblins, Hobgoblins, and Bugbears live in outposts and small societies on the outskirts of civilization. They are squeezed by the Wilderness of the West and the Savagery of the East. Over the last 400 years they have moved ever Westward as they have been driven back by polite society. Many goblinoid outposts have outcasts of other races among them. Some are crafty enough to hold positions in the East still, but they always face the threat of Civitate aggression. While many believe these races are only able to leech and pillage off other societies for survival, they are knowledgable in farming many kinds of foods.

#  Civitates
## Durver
One of the first Civitates to reemerge, Durver sits where Via Sol meets the Eastern Sea. It is a trade capital, shipping goods all along the East and South Coast and has a lot of Old Money.
## Freyeen
Another very old Civitas with Freyen College being the oldest educational institution in Aveus. About 180 mi west of Durver on Via Sol, it exports many scholars as well as inventors and engineers. Situated on the Yen River.
## Andarad
Militaristic, Honor bound. Very old Civitas with a sizeable Orc population. Andarad has a very elitist and isolated military, but their military is also second to none. It is about 150 mi west of Freyeen along Via Sol. Andarad is located in a hilly region, away from any large river, but has a 50 mile aqueduct from the source of the Radian River in the mountain to the south. Durver, Freyeen, and Andarad are the three oldest Civitates and the largest seats of power in Aveus.
## Eldhium
The next major Civitate on Via Sol is on the Lagom River. A ways north, upstream along this river sits the Lagom Lake, and the river continues upstream to the West into the Urist Mountain Range, and nears the Dwarven Capital, Eldhold. Due to Eldhium's easy access to the Dwarven Kingdom, it has many Dwarves there, and many industries related to Dwarfkind, such as Masonry, Smithing, and Brewing.
## Latisrade
Through the sparse Litast Mountains to the North, in the Iteb Forest Bay, is Latisrade, a northern Civitate known for Meat Exports as well as its Wool and Textile industry.
## Naranum
The Southernmost Civitate, on the Southern Coast in the Olin Swamps, Naranum grows many fruits that don't seem to do well elsewhere. This includes citrus and vitus, and they export the finest wines and fruits in Aveus
## Haephus
South of Eldhium and Andarad, Haephus straddles a deep forested biome and a wide plains biome. The logging industry is strong here, along with wooden durable goods like wagons, barrels, and even riverboats. Additionally, Haephus breeds horses for most of Aveus, allowing the Viae to be used to their full effect.
## Pradla
A mercenary powerhouse. This Civitate located just South of the big three, has profited off of training Freyeen's and Durver's soldiers and officers (often taught by deserters from Andarad) and has provided mercenaries for when the big three have disagreements.
## Mysoum
West of the Urist Mountain range, on Via Sol after it goes through the Tobul. This is the Civitate furthest West on Via Sol. While it has the traditional Civator and Senate of a modern Civitate, the corruption of the Civitas along with it being a juicy target isolated West of the Urist Mountains as it is makes this Civitas seem incompetent and always struggling against the wilderness of Urist and the plains around it.

# Gods
The Old Empire had a monotheistic religion according to all recovered documents.
New Aveus has an adversarial pantheon. That is, most ideas have two gods which express either side of that concept. One can worship a single side of that relationship, or the balance of both. There are some gods, however, which are not adversarial and stand alone in their field.
