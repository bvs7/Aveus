# This World
Almost 1,000 years ago, a calamity shook the world. The continent of Aveus fell into a period of disarray and mistrust. A five century sized void sits in the annals of history. Between years 0-500 PC (post calamitat) very little is known and similarly very little is know about the cause or outcome of this calamity. From before the year 1 AC (ante calamitat), artifacts of the Glorious Civilization, the Old Empire that stretched across the continent exist. One such evidence of that society is the Sun Road (Via Sol). A massive highway that once stretched from Eastern Sea to Western Sea. 

When in the East, the Civitates, (autonomous city-states) finally rose from the ashes of the Empire, Via Sol was overgrown, in disrepair, and nigh unusable. Travel from one Civitas to another was dangerous, as Post Calamitat wilds held new threats since the age of the Empire. Slowly civilization expanded, with the reconstruction of the Viae. 

Around 400 years later, in the Spring of 983 PC, a great region has been reclaimed. Civitates protect the farmlands near them, making the safest lands those closest to a reconstructed Via. The farther West you travel, the farther you likely are from a Via, and the less likely you are to be under the might of a Civitas.

Some prefer life away from the auspices of a Civator or of a Senate, and they often travel West until they strike a balance between Freedom and Safety. The Sun Road now stretches all the way to the Tyrra River, where sits Fort Tyrrasol.
