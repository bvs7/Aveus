A year is divided into 12 months, each 24 days long according to the Aveusian Pantheon:

The Season of Nitae (Autumn):
- Nitais (September)
- Tyrrais (October)
- Yenais (November)

The Season of Friae (Winter):
- Friais (December)
- Novais (January)
- Reorais (February)

The Season of Vivae (Spring):
- Vivus (March)
- Pizus (April)
- Radus (May)

The Season of Flanae (Summer):
- Flanus (June)
- Luxus (July)
- Mielus (August)

These 12 months are subdivided in the following pattern:
- The 1st is known as Kalends of a month.
- The 5th is known as Nons of a month.
- The 13th is known as Ides of a month.

Similarly, these dates divide the months in the following way:
- The 14th - 1st is called the Kalends.
- The 2nd - 5th is called the Nons.
- The 6th - 13th is called the Ides.

- The 14th - 19th is often called the Midkalends, and the 20th - 1st called the Postkalends.

Even numbered years are known as years of Sol, and odd years are years of Luna. At the end of Sol years, there is an 11-12 day intercalary period. During Sol, new moons occur on Kalends of each month. During Luna, full moons occur on Kalends of each month.

At the end of Luna, there is another 11-12 day intercalary period. Rarely, there is an additional 24 day month known as Temorae. The length of intercalary periods and the occurrence of Temorae is decided by the Astronomical College of the Freyan University.

Traditionally, dates are counted inclusively from the next Kalends, Nons, or Ides. (i.e. the 3rd is "2 from Nons"; the 18th is "7 from Kalends"). This practice has fallen out of favor for all but the most formal occasions like legal documents and announcements. The months also have alternative names which they are sometimes called (Gregorian calendar months)
