#  Civitates
## Durver
One of the first Civitates to reemerge, Durver sits where Via Sol meets the Eastern Sea. It is a trade capital, shipping goods all along the East and South Coast and has a lot of Old Money.
## Freyeen
Another very old Civitas with Freyen College being the oldest educational institution in Aveus. About 180 mi west of Durver on Via Sol, it exports many scholars as well as inventors and engineers. Situated on the Yen River.
## Andarad
Militaristic, Honor bound. Very old Civitas with a sizeable Orc population. Andarad has a very elitist and isolated military, but their military is also second to none. It is about 150 mi west of Freyeen along Via Sol. Andarad is located in a hilly region, away from any large river, but has a 50 mile aqueduct from the source of the Radian River in the mountain to the south. Durver, Freyeen, and Andarad are the three oldest Civitates and the largest seats of power in Aveus.
## Eldhium
The next major Civitate on Via Sol is on the Lagom River. A ways north, upstream along this river sits the Lagom Lake, and the river continues upstream to the West into the Urist Mountain Range, and nears the Dwarven Capital, Eldhold. Due to Eldhium's easy access to the Dwarven Kingdom, it has many Dwarves there, and many industries related to Dwarfkind, such as Masonry, Smithing, and Brewing.
## Latisrade
Through the sparse Litast Mountains to the North, in the Iteb Forest Bay, is Latisrade, a northern Civitate known for Meat Exports as well as its Wool and Textile industry.
## Naranum
The Southernmost Civitate, on the Southern Coast in the Olin Swamps, Naranum grows many fruits that don't seem to do well elsewhere. This includes citrus and vitus, and they export the finest wines and fruits in Aveus
## Haephus
South of Eldhium and Andarad, Haephus straddles a deep forested biome and a wide plains biome. The logging industry is strong here, along with wooden durable goods like wagons, barrels, and even riverboats. Additionally, Haephus breeds horses for most of Aveus, allowing the Viae to be used to their full effect.
## Pradla
A mercenary powerhouse. This Civitate located just South of the big three, has profited off of training Freyeen's and Durver's soldiers and officers (often taught by deserters from Andarad) and has provided mercenaries for when the big three have disagreements.
## Mysoum
West of the Urist Mountain range, on Via Sol after it goes through the Tobul. This is the Civitate furthest West on Via Sol. While it has the traditional Civator and Senate of a modern Civitate, the corruption of the Civitas along with it being a juicy target isolated West of the Urist Mountains as it is makes this Civitas seem incompetent and always struggling against the wilderness of Urist and the plains around it.
