# Gods
The Old Empire had a monotheistic religion according to all recovered documents.
New Aveus has an adversarial pantheon. That is, most ideas have two gods which express either side of that concept. One can worship a single side of that relationship, or the balance of both. There are some gods, however, which are not adversarial and stand alone in their field.

Most worship is done at a religious building dedicated to no god in particular. These buildings are called pantheons. Sometimes ardent acolytes of a deity will build a temple which is usually dedicated to a subset of deities. Most of the time, these temples can still be used for any worship, but they usually have dedicated architecture or features meant for a specific type of worship.
