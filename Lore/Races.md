# Races
## Humans
Most Civitates are human founded and human run. Human civilization is the most populous and usually the most accepting of other races and cultures. They depend very heavily on Viae, more so than other races. Unlike the other races, Human populations and settlements grow quickly, and this is one main reason they are so populous in the resurgence after the Calamitat.
## Dwarves
Dwarves build strongholds in the Mountains and Hills to the Northwest the East Coast. They are nominally tied together under a Dwarven King, but many clans and factions exert control over dwarven society. A large network of tunnels connects much of their civilization.
## Elves
Elves have old settlements in The forests and swamps of the South (Wood Elves), and also the coniferous forest to the North (High Elves). The elven cities on Viae benefit much from trade, but many elves dislike the commotion and destruction that comes with Via construction and travel, and prefer natural forest paths instead.
## Halflings
Some small halfling settlements exist along riverbanks, in grasslands, and other gentle land. They are typically subsistence farming communities and get along well with humans. Most Halfling settlements along Viae can no longer be called halfling settlements as the halfling population has been long outnumbered.
## Gnomes
While some guess that Gnomes once had ancestral homelands, today's gnomes have been fully adopted into human society, and are pretty evenly interspersed in human life in Civitates. Humans and gnomes usually get along quite well.
## Dragonborn
Very rarely are such beings sighted. Dragonborn are sometimes found in small clans, but more often than not are solitary.
## Orcs
Orcs are typically nomadic, and very loyal to their clans. Orcs clans make great mercenaries and are often on the front lines against the dangerous wilderness that threatens to impose itself on civilization. In Andarad there is a legend of a clan of orcs that saved the civitate and were given homes and honor for their bravery. To this day, Andarad has a sizeable Orc population. Not all Orc clans can come to such mutually beneficial arrangements, and many have spent time looting farms and villages for subsistence.
## Goblinoids
Goblins, Hobgoblins, and Bugbears live in outposts and small societies on the outskirts of civilization. They are squeezed by the Wilderness of the West and the Savagery of the East. Over the last 400 years they have moved ever Westward as they have been driven back by polite society. Many goblinoid outposts have outcasts of other races among them. Some are crafty enough to hold positions in the East still, but they always face the threat of Civitate aggression. While many believe these races are only able to leech and pillage off other societies for survival, they are knowledgable in farming many kinds of foods.
