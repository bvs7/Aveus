## Minor Rules
Inspiration: A play can store a maximum of 2 Inspiration.

## Delay
Before your turn starts, you can choose to use your reaction to Delay your turn until later in the Initiative order. All effects that would normally end at the beginning of your turn end now. You choose to start your turn after any creature's turn now, with the exception of being able to split up creatures that move simultaneously.

## Flanking
When you and an ally are holding melee weapons on two opposite sides of enemy no more than one size larger than you, they take a -2 penalty to their AC. When you and allies are fully surrounding an enemy no more than one size larger than you, they take a -5 penalty to their AC.

## Stealth, Cover, and Lighting
To reiterate the cover and lighting rules:
- A creature is lightly obscured from another when they are in dim light, patchy fog, moderate foilage, etc.
- A creature is heavily obscured from another when they are in darkness, opaque fog, dense foilage, etc.
- A creature can have half-cover, three-quarters cover, or total cover from an enemy.
You can hide from a creature when you have total cover from them, when you are heavily obscured, or when you are lightly obscured and have three-quarters cover from them.
