Coin values are readjusted. 1 silver is worth what normally costs one gold in the PHB. 1 gold is worth what normally costs 100 gold in the PHB. In other words

- 1 copper is still one copper.
- 100 copper = 1 silver
- 100 silver = 1 gold

Additional coins:
- 1 brass piece = 10 copper, 10 brass = 1 silver
- 1 electrum piece = 10 silver, 10 electrum = 1 gold
- 1 platinum = 10 gold

These are less common coins, but often useful as change.
