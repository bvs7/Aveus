When you first gain proficiency in a language, you only gain the ability to speak and understand it. During character creation, you can choose to forego the knowledge of another language to gain proficiency in reading and writing a language you can speak. In addition, every character gains one extra language proficiency of their choice. Don't forget to add background languages. In addition, there is a special language called Ancient which belonged to the Old Empire. It is a dead language and your first proficiency in Ancient is proficiency in reading and writing it, as it cannot be used effectively for speech.

For example, let's say I am creating a human with an Acolyte background. Humans know common and one extra language, Acolytes learn two extra languages, and I get one extra language. This means I have proficiency in speaking Common, and 4 more proficiencies to dole out. I could apply it in one of the following ways:
- Speak: Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, Gnomish, Goblin, Orc; Read: None
- Speak: Common, Dwarven; Read: Common, Dwarven, Ancient
- Speak: Common, Goblin, Elven; Read: Common, Ancient
