## Carrying Capacity
A player's comfortable carrying capacity in slots is 5 + their STR modifier. If they carry more than this their speed is halved, they have disadvantage on DEX based saving throws and ability checks, and during travel they must travel at a slow pace or take a level of exhaustion at the end of the day of travel.

A player's maximum carrying capacity in slots is 10 + their STR modifier. If they try to carry more than this their speed is 0.

Some items are Light (L) and some are Negligible (-). The number of Light items you have divided by 10, rounded down, is the number of slots needed for your light items. Negligible items never spend slots.

Most equipment listed on the equipment Page of the handbook is Light.
Anything that weighs less than one pound is negligible, and things become a full slot rather than Light between 3 and 10 lbs, depending on how unwieldy they are. Anything at or over 10 pounds is at least one slot.

Backpacks hold 5 slots, require an action to take off or access
Satchel hold 2 slots, Sacks hold 5 slots (require a hand), require bonus action to drop or access.
Belt/Pouch holds Light Items.
