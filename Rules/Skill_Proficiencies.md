# Languages

When you first gain proficiency in a language, you only gain the ability to speak and understand it. During character creation, you can choose to forego the knowledge of another language to gain proficiency in reading and writing a language you can speak. In addition, every character gains one extra language proficiency of their choice. Don't forget to add background languages. In addition, there is a special language called Ancient which belonged to the Old Empire. It is a dead language and your first proficiency in Ancient is proficiency in reading and writing it, as it cannot be used effectively for speech.

For example, let's say I am creating a human with an Acolyte background. Humans know common and one extra language, Acolytes learn two extra languages, and I get one extra language. This means I have proficiency in speaking Common, and 4 more proficiencies to dole out. I could apply it in one of the following ways:
- Speak: Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, Gnomish, Goblin, Orc; Read: None
- Speak: Common, Dwarven; Read: Common, Dwarven, Ancient
- Speak: Common, Goblin, Elven; Read: Common, Ancient

To learn to speak a language you must spend 6 months of downtime in a setting where that language is spoken to you and used by you daily, or by paying a tutor 1 gp/day each day to speak the language to you.

To learn to read/write a lanugage you must spend 6 months of downtime total and 10 gp/day on a tutor. Written language tutors are not always easy to find.

# Skills/Tools/Weapons/Armor
During character creation, when allocating skill proficiencies, if you could possible apply proficiency to a skill 3 times, you can choose to use those three proficiencies to gain expertise in a skill.

You can gain proficiency in a skill/tool/weapon/armor by spending a total of 2 months of downtime (60 days), spending 3 gp/day on a tutor.

You can gain expertise in a skill by spending a total of 6 months of downtime (180 days), spending 10 gp/day on a tutor. Expert tutors are not always easy to find.
