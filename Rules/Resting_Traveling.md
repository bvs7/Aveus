  - +5 for no bed, +2 for bedroll
  - +10 for no meal, +5 for cold rations
  - +5 for using up hours of light activity (keeping watch, etc)
  - +5 for each slot of armor being worn

- Going to 0 HP during combat grants a level of exhaustion

## Traveling
A party is granted 100 points with which to travel each day on the map. Traveling into a hex or square expends the cost of that hex times the pace multiplier. So, for example, traveling into a normal terrain hex like grassland at a normal pace expends 4 x 3 points, or 9 points. For Large Scale travel, the points needed for the full journey are calculated and the travel time based on that.

A party can choose to take a level of exhaustion each in order to add 25 points of travel to their day.
